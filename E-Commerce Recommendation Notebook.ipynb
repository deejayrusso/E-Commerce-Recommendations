    "The purpose of this project is to identify reasonable complements to items a customer is interested in by identifying other items that are often purchased in the same transaction as the item of interest. The reasonable complements can be recommended to the customer through the context of \"customers who viewed ... also viewed...\" and \"customers who purchased ... also purchased...\" for the purpose of identifying alternative items or add-on items.\n",
    "\n",
    "The recommendations will be generated by using the apriori algorithm to extract frequent itemsets for association rule mining. The association rules will take the antecedent (item being viewed/purchased) and recommend associated consequents (complementary items) with the specified support and lift.\n",
    "\n",
    "####  <u> Key Terms </u>\n",
    "<ul><b>Association Rules:</b> Probability of association between items based on how frequently they are purchased together. If (X) purchased then (Y) has a higher probability of being purchased. </ul>\n",
    "<ul><b>Antecedent:</b> Item being viewed or purchased. </ul> \n",
    "<ul><b>Consequent:</b> Other item(s) that are frequently purchased in the same transaction.</ul>\n",
    "<ul><b>Support:</b> The relative frequency the antecedent and consequent show up in the same transactions.</ul>\n",
    "<ul><b>Lift:</b> The ratio of the observed support to what is expected if the two rules were independent and the item association was completely random.</ul>\n",
    "<ul><b>Confidence:</b> The reliability measure for the association rules.</ul>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The data used will be two datasets that have been combined. There is a dataset with six months of transactions where items in the \"adhesives and sealants\" category were purchased and another dataset containing all transactions over a two week period. The raw data contains:\n",
    "\n",
    "<ul><b>Order Number:</b> The unique identifier for each individual transaction</ul>\n",
    "<ul><b>l1:</b> Level 1 product identifier (most broad)</ul>\n",
    "<ul><b>l2:</b> Level 2 product identifier</ul>\n",
    "<ul><b>l3:</b> Level 3 product identifier (most granular)</ul>\n",
    "<ul><b>Sku:</b> The unique identifier for a specific item</ul>\n",
